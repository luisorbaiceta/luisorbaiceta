## Hola! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luis and I'm an architect from Spain. With my passion for great design and memorable user experiences, comes a lot of dedication to software development and a huge curiosity for new technologies.

I typed my first line of code with my father at the age of 7 and haven't had the time to stop since then ðŸ˜‚

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in [Orbaiceta & Aldaba](https://www.orbaiceta-aldaba.com/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Architecture and Design
- âš¡ Fun fact: I had to add this fun fact because people thought I'm a software architect, but I'm actually a [building]() architect ðŸ˜‰
